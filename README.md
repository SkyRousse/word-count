## Description

 This is the week one independent project for the Ruby class at Epicodus. In this project we are putting to practice our knowledge of BDD with ruby using Sinatra. The objectives are as follows:

* Allow the user to choose toppings and size for the pizza they'd like to order.
* Create a pizza object constructor with properties for toppings and size.
* Create a prototype method for the cost of a pizza depending on the selections chosen.
* Specs have complete coverage for the behaviors that need to be tested.
* Specs are passing.
* Logic is easy to understand.
* Code has proper indentation and spacing.
* Variable names are descriptive.
* Integration specs are passing.
* Sinatra application uses views, instance variables and forms.
* Good Git documentation (regular commits with clear, consistently formatted messages and a complete README).
* Message syntax should complete the sentence "This commit will..."; for example "update image files on the home page".
* README should include application name, author name, description, setup instructions, licensing.
* Application is deployed to Heroku (see link below).
* Discuss the flow of your code and the concepts behind it with an instructor using correct terminology.
